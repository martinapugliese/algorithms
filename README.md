# Algorithms

Repo with code (scripts and notebooks) about some algorithms analysed in their workings and performance. The input material may be from university courses (there are references). Code will be primarily in Python with occasionally other languages.

##Â Peak finder 

This algorithm is from course ["Introduction to algorithms" @MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/), taught in fall 2011 by Proff. E Demaine and S Devadas and is analysed in lecture 1.

In the notebook, I just code the two versions analysed in the lecture and do some plots of the asymptotic complexity.

## Perceptron neuron

A perceptron neuron, coded in C++.
