# A Neural Networks compilation

This repo contains implementations of various neural networks and their uses, for fun. Languages can be either C++ or Python. None of this code should be used in production as it's made for illustrative purposes and for playing around. List of contents here.

## Data

The datasets used in the code.

## Perceptron

Codes a perceptron neuron from scratch in C++ and a way to use it as a NAND gate.

## Python networks

These networks are coded in Python.
